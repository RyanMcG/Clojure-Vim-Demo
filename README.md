# Vim & Clojure Demo

## Overview

If you want to do write Clojure with Vim and you want to make it as easy and
interactive as possible you have two choices:

1.  [VimClojure](https://bitbucket.org/kotarak/vimclojure/overview)
2.  [Slimv](https://bitbucket.org/kovisoft/slimv/overview)

The former is great, but doesn't use swank or cdt :(

The later has potential but is somewhat buggy.

## Easy

Dave Ray made a project to help you *easily* set up VimClojure and all of its
parts. If you did not understand my explanation/want to learn more check it out.
